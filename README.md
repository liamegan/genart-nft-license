# GenArt NFT License
A license for Generative art NFTs.

This license was drafted as a response to the lack of appropriate and unambiguous licensing for generative NFTs. It attempts to capture the most useful parts of common licenses (cc by-nc-nd 4.0, MIT etc.) used and adds to those considerations of components uniquely tied to generative NFTs; namely iterations, metadata and "previews".

It allows:
- **Display and Reproduction**: Anyone can display and reproduce the Artwork, provided they attribute it to the Creator.
- **Resale of NFT**: Owners can resell the NFT associated with an Iteration, as long as the new owner agrees to this License's terms.
- **Attribution Required**: Any display or reproduction of the Artwork must include appropriate credit to the Creator, specifying the Creator's name, and the Project's description and title.

It limits:
- **No Modifications**: Users are not allowed to modify, adapt, create derivative works from, or otherwise alter the Project or any Artwork.
- **No Commercial Use**: The Project and Artwork cannot be used for commercial purposes or direct financial gain.
- **No Additional Rights**: Users cannot attempt to trademark, copyright, or acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Artwork or Iteration.
- **Termination on Breach**: The License and its granted rights automatically terminate if a user breaches its terms.
